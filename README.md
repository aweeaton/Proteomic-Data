Visualizing protein phosphorylation changes and CRISPR scores

The purpose of this notebook was to look at any relationships between phosphorylation changes and CRISPR scores.

Multiple lymphoma cell lines were used in these experiments. We were interested in developing a new score for genes that included how essential the gene is and how its phosphorylation status changes from different perturbations - such as a drug treatment.

We highlit new "hits", where the CRISPR and phosphorylation scores for a gene are beyond certain threshold values that we set.
